# Centerfuge

Basically a centerfuge is a big spinning cylindrical vortex in the center of your home that rotates and sorts and distributes materials to build and repair your home, as well as clothing and food, as it hyperbolates waste.

Hyperbolation is the process of labeling and wrapping materials in layered yarn-balls (also known as gnotobiotic hyperballs or cognets).
